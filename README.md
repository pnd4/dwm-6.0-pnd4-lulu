# dwm-6.0-pnd4-lulu

Packaged for Arch, this is my personal take on Suckless' masterpiece WM, dwm, for use on the Dell Chromebook 13 (lulu). 

# Basics

For use with the official `dmenu` [Alt+P] and `rxvt-unicode` [Alt+Enter] Archlinux packages.

The default font is 'Tamsynmod' which can be found (HERE)[https://sourceforge.net/projects/tamsynmod/]. 

I've also put together a status bar which can be found (HERE)[https://github.com/pnd4/dwmstatus-pnd4-lulu].

Support for Chromebook-keys. For example: [Search+Volume_Up] will increase your alsamixer's 'master' volume by 3%.
